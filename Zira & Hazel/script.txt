Zira:  Can't believe they're playing this song! The perfect one for a slow dance.

Hazel:  Yeah, perfect for people who actually know how to dance.

Zira: Come on, Hazel, loosen up a little! This is meant to be fun.

Hazel:  Right, because nothing screams "fun" like stepped-on toes and awkward twirling.

Zira:  Well then, prepare yourself because I'm about to make this dance unforgettable.

Hazel:  Oh, please do. Unforgettable is your middle name, after all.

Zira:  Alright, let's do this. Just follow my lead.

Hazel:  Are you sure? I feel like following your lead often results in chaos.

Zira:  Oh, come on, Hazel. Chaos is just another word for excitement.

Hazel:  And here I thought it was a word for "mess created by Zira."

Zira:  Alright, here's the dip. Ready?

Hazel:  Um, I guess so.



Zira: See? Wasn't that amazing?

Hazel:  Yes, positively breath-taking. I hope you aim to keep your day job.

Zira:  Oh, don't worry. I've got another talent up my sleeve.

Hazel:  Really? And what might that be?

Zira:  Kissing.

Hazel:  Oh, is that so?



Zira:  I knew you couldn't resist me, Hazel.

Hazel:  Oh yes, Zira, how could I ever resist your charms?

Zira:  You can't, darling. You just can't.

Hazel:  Alright, enough of your charm offensive. Let's just stick to dancing, shall we?

Zira:  Fair enough, Hazel. Just remember, I'm always ready to sweep you off your feet, literally.

Hazel:  Oh, how lucky I am to have you, Zira. What would I do without you?

Zira:  Be lost in an ocean of dullness, my dear Hazel. Be lost indeed.
